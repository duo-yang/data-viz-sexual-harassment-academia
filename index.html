        This visualization is a course project for SI 649, information visualization. The dataset is gained from an online survey conducted by Dr. Kelsky.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Total Data</div>
        The data has reported 2468 sexual harassment incidents in total. The incidents are reported from all over the world.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Overview of the data</div>
        Each dot represents a reported incident.

        <div class="title">Incidents Reported to Authorities</div>
        <span style="color: #d7443f">Red dots</span> represents the incidents where perpetrators were reported to the departments. <span style="color: #ddd">Grey dots</span> reprents the unreported incidents and lignt grey dots represents unknown reported.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Gender of Perpetrators</div>
        Vast majority of the perpetrators are <span style="color: #d7443f">Male</span>.
        And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Type of Institutions</div>
        Most incidents happened in <span style="color: #d7443f">research universities</span>.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Mental Impact</div>
        This chart shows the mental impact extracted from the original data. We can see that the <span style="color: #d7443f">anxiety</span>, <span style="color: #d7443f">depression</span>, and <span style="color: #d7443f">stress</span> are the three major mental impact of the incidents to the victims.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        <div class="title">Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div>
        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
